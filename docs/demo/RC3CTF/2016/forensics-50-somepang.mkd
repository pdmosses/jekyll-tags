### Description

> Examine the file and find the flag.

### Solution

First, open the pcap file with Wireshark. We can see 98906 ICMP frames with the same length. Look at the data, it's always the same character repeated in each request/reply.
The last packet data character is "=" so we can imagine that stuff encoded in base64.
Let capture all characters and decode it to a file :

```python
# author : Chill3d
import base64
import os
from scapy.all import *

pcap=rdpcap("./somepang.pcap" )
string=""
i=0
for packet in pcap:
    i=i+1
    if(i%2==0):
        string+=str(packet)[-2:]

file_t=open("flag","w" )
file_t.write(base64.b64decode(string))
file_t.close()

print string
print base64.b64decode(string)
```

This will create a file nammed flag. Let's see which type of file was produced :

```
$ file flag
flag: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 72x72, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=2, orientation=upper-left], baseline, precision 8, 720x449, frames 3
```

Open it with a picture viewer :

Flag : `RC3-2016-PANG-ME-LIKE-ONE-OF-YOU-FRENCH-GORILLAZ`
